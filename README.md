This repository contains two circuit examples


1. Maze problem solving: A prover can demonstrate knowledge of an exact maze-solving path through Zero-Knowledge proofs without revealing the path itself.

2. Computer vision task example: In real-world applications, the input image and the model's internal state (weights and gradients) are treated as private. Users can verify the model's execution integrity without disclosing the input image or the model itself.
